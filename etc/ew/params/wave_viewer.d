# server
#    This is the IP address and port of the wave_server that wave_viewer 
#		 should connect to.
#    The format is "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX PORT#"
#

# Wave_Server
server 192.168.0.1 12001



# start
#    Sets the start time of the display (seconds since 1970).
#

# scale
#    Sets the scale is the maximum +/- value that can be displayed
#    for each band.  If a value in the trace is greater than the 
#    scale, it will be truncated to the scale value.  The "scale"
#    config command provides a method for making the scale values
#    for all channels the same.  
#
#scale 500


# band
#    Sets the starting height of each band in pixels.  Wave_viewer will
#    attempt to fit as many bands on the screen as possible, given the
#    band height.
#
band 50


# TimeTillUnblock
#    Time in seconds that wave_viewer will wait before unblocking 
#		 blocked traces.  It can be useful to set this value to a low 
#		 number (5), if you are trying to view trace at the bleeding 
#		 edge of the tank.  
#		 WARNING!! the lower the number is set, the larger the load
#    placed on wave_viewer and it's corresponding WAVE SERVER will be.  
#		 So please try to use a number closer to 25 (the default) if you 
#		 are not needing to look at bleeding edge data.
#
# TimeTillUnblock 5


# auto_scroll
#    When in auto_scroll mode, this is the automated window scrolling 
#		 interval (in seconds).  
#		 NOTE:  due to other constraints, the minimum scrolling value 
#		 is 0.5 seconds.  Setting this value below 0.5 will not cause 
#		 wave_viewer to scroll more often.  Setting this value above
#    0.5 will cause wave_viewer to scroll less frequently.
#
# auto_scroll 1.0


# gulp
#    The maximum amount of trace (in seconds) to request from 
#    wave_server in a single request.  Wave_viewer will never 
#    ask for more than "gulp" seconds of data in a single 
#    request.  If wave_viewer wants 60 seconds of data, and 
#    "gulp" is set to 10, then it will make 6 "10 second" 
#    requests to get the 60 seconds of data.
#
gulp 10


# cache
#    This is the local cache size in # of samples.  So if you 
#    have 200hz data, and you set the cache size to 20000, then 
#    wave_viewer will cache 100 seconds of data.  If you had 
#    1 hz data then wave_viewer would cache 20000 seconds of data.
#    WARNING!!  The total amount of memory that wave_viewer will 
#    attempt to grab is equal to 3MB + (# of channels in the given 
#    wave_server) * (cache size) * (sizeof(int)).  So if you
#    connect to a wave_server that serves 100 channels, and you set 
#    cache to 20000, then memory usage should be close to 
#    3000kb + (100 * 20k * 4b) = 11000kb = 11MB.  (4 is sizeof(int))
#
#    20000 is 200 seconds worth of 100hz data.  (80kb/channel)
cache 20000  


# max_trace
#    Maximum number of traces that wave_viewer will handle.  If a 
#    wave_server serves more than <max_trace> channels, then 
#    wave_viewer will pay attention to only the first <max_trace>
#    channels, ignoring the rest.
max_trace 128


# group
#    Denotes the beginning of a block of lines that describe a group 
#    of channels.  Groups can then be selected from the wave_viewer 
#    menu bar, in order to view only a subset of channels, in the
#    order specified in the config file.  When specifying groups in 
#    the config file, use the following format:
#    group <GROUP_NAME>
#     <STA1> <CHAN1> <NET1> [<LOC1>]
#     <STA2> <CHAN2> <NET2> [<LOC2>]
#     <STA3> <CHAN3> <NET3> [<LOC3>]
#    <BLANK LINE WITH NO SPACES>
