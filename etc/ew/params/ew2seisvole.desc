#    Heartbeat Specification.  If the status manager does not receive
#    a heartbeat message every <tsec> seconds from this module, an
#    error will be reported (client module dead).  <page> is the maximum
#    number of pager messages that will be reported and <mail> is the
#    maximum number of email messages that will be reported.  If the
#    page or mail limit is exceeded, no further errors will be reported

# Uncomment the "restartMe" line to enable automatic restart of this

#    A list of possible errors follows.
#
#    <err> is the error number of the error generated by the
#    module.  Error numbers can be any unsigned integer, not
#    necessarily sequential.
#
#    <nerr> and <rate> specify the maximum allowable error rate.
#    If the error rate exceeds <nerr> errors per <tsec> seconds,
#    an email or pager message may be reported.  To report all
#    errors, set nerr to 1 and tsec to 0.
#
#    <page> is the maximum number of pager messages that will be
#    reported and <mail> is maximum number of email messages that
#    will be reported.  If the page or mail limit is exceeded, no
#    further errors will be reported until the status manager is
#    restarted.
#
#    <text> is a character string that will be reported.
#    Enclose string in double-quotes if it contains embedded 
#    blanks.
#    Each module may also issue a text string for an error.
