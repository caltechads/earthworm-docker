# FILE: srpar2ew.d                      Copyright (c), Symmetric Research, 2004-2010
#
# This is the SrPar2Ew parameter file for acquiring data with a 
# Symmetric Research PARxCH 24 bit A/D board and putting that
# data onto an earthworm ring.
#
# The standard earthworm import_generic/export (or export_scnl) functions
# can be used to transfer PARxCH tracebuf data from a local WAVE_RING to
# a WAVE_RING on another machine.  If you have data from two different
# PARxCH boards arriving at the same ring, you must ensure that each is
# using a different ModuleId.  Otherwise, the two sets of data will 
# appear to be scrambled together which leads to lots of message sequence
# number errors.
#
# If you wish to use MOD_SRPAR2EW for a ModuleId instead of
# MOD_ADSEND_C, you must first define it in your earthworm.d file.
#
#
# You will also need to edit other earthworm .d files in order to
# acquire and work with PARxCH data.  A simple configuration where the
# PARxCH files are acquired, saved, and viewed on one computer would
# require making edits similar to those shown below for the following files:
# 
# startstop.d - Use this file to tell earthworm to run srpar2ew to 
#               acquire data by adding lines like these for Windows:
#
#   Process          "srpar2ew srpar2ew.d"
#   PriorityClass     Normal
#   ThreadPriority    Normal
#   Display           NewConsole
#
#               Or like these for Linux:
#
#   Process          "srpar2ew srpar2ew.d"
#   Class/Priority   RR 5
#
# wave_serverV.d - Use this file to save the acquired PARxCH data into
#                  tanks.  You will need to add lines giving the channel
#                  SCNL information, size, and tank location.  The proper
#                  size is determined by the sampling rate.  Each PARxCH
#                  record will be about 1 second long so the size needed
#                  is (SamplingRate+1)*sizeof(long)+sizeof(tracebuf header).
#                  For example, at 100 sps -> 101*4+64 =  468 
#                  and          at 500 sps -> 501*4+64 = 2068
#                  You may need to increase MaxMsgSize to accomodate the
#                  larger values.  For the PAR1CH at 100 sps one might 
#                  add lines like these.
#
#   Tank    CH00 xxx SR -- 480   INST_UNKNOWN  MOD_WILDCARD       1         10000         c:\earthworm\run_symres\data\CH00.tnk
#   Tank    MARK xxx SR -- 480   INST_UNKNOWN  MOD_WILDCARD       1         10000         c:\earthworm\run_symres\data\MARK.tnk
# 
# wave_viewer.d - Use this file to view the acquired PARxCH data.  You 
#                 will need to give the IP address and port for the 
#                 wave_server storing the data.  You may also want to add
#                 group lines identifying the channels to display.
#
#   group PAR1CH_Sites
#          CH00 xxx SR --
#          MARK xxx SR --
#
# A more complicated configuration would involve acquiring the PARxCH
# data on one computer and sending it to another for saving, processing,
# and viewing.  In that case, you would need to edit startstop.d, 
# srpar2ew.d and export_scnl.d, on the acquiring computer.  On the 
# other computer, you would need to edit startstop.d, import_generic.d, 
# wave_serverV.d and wave_viewer.d.
#
# For the export/import pair, you will need to set their IP addresses to
# point to each other, set up the heartbeat strings so that each looks for 
# the string the other is sending, and set the timeouts so that each sender
# sends a heartbeat more often than the listener requires.  You will also 
# want to include lines identifying the channels to send.  For example
#
# Send_scnl       CH00 xxx SR --                # send this specific channel
# Send_scnl       MARK xxx SR --                # send this specific channel
#
#
# Now, on to the srpar2ew.d values ...

#
# Channel info: SCNL AND PIN VALUES FOR EACH A/D CHANNEL
#
# EwChannelScnl lines relate the PARxCH channel numbers to the SCNL and pin
# numbers used to identify channels in an earthworm system.  The pin
# numbers are optional.  If a pin number is not specified for a channel, 
# the pin number is set to the A/D channel number.
#
# Three different versions of this section are given below showing how
# the setup would look when using the PAR1CH, PAR4CH, or PAR8CH.  Only
# the version corresponding to the PARxCH you are actually using should
# be commented in, the other two should be commented out.
#
# The older keyword EwChannel is the same, except it has no location value.
# If OutputMsgType = TYPE_TRACEBUF2 and EwChannel is used, the location field
# defaults to "--" which means a blank location.
