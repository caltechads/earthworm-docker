#--------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE: Send_scn and Send_scn_remap commands are now obsolete, and
# have been replaced with Send_scnl and Send_scnl_remap (which
# include the location code field).  If the old commands are used,
# ringdup_scn sets the location code field to * (wildcard).
#
# Use any combination of Send_scnl (to send data as-is) and
#   Send_scnl_remap (to change the SCNL on the fly) commands.
# Use * as a wildcard for any field. A wildcard in the
#   "map to" fields of Send_scnl_remap means that field will
#   not be renamed.
# Use the Block_scnl command (works with both wildcards
#   and not, but only makes sense to use with wildcards) to block
#   any specific channels that you don't want sent.
#   Note, the Block commands must precede any wildcard commands for 
#   the blocking to occur.
